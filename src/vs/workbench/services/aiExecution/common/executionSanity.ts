/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  AI Execution Kernel -- Phase 29: Execution Sanity Validation
 *  Real Vibecode -- AI-Native IDE
 *
 *  IExecutionSanityService -- Detect and prevent hallucinated success.
 *
 *  The system must distrust ambiguous success and require evidence.
 *  This service validates that claimed outcomes match reality.
 *
 *  REAL responsibilities:
 *    - Output sanity checks: verify command output is not empty/trivial
 *    - Impossible-state detection: catch contradictions in execution state
 *    - Verification contradiction detection: build says success but no artifacts
 *    - Execution consistency validation: state transitions are logical
 *    - Milestone completion proof validation: require evidence for completion
 *
 *  Examples of hallucinated success that this service detects:
 *    - Build says success but artifacts are missing from expected paths
 *    - Test runner exited but no tests actually ran
 *    - Git commit reported success but commit hash is missing
 *    - File claimed edited but checksum unchanged
 *    - Verification passed but output is suspiciously empty
 *    - Command exited with code 0 but stderr contains "error"
 *    - Milestone marked completed with no steps completed
 *
 *  HONEST limitations:
 *    - Sanity checks are heuristic; they may produce false positives
 *      (flagging legitimate successes as suspicious) or false negatives
 *      (missing subtle hallucinations)
 *    - Artifact detection depends on knowing expected output paths
 *    - Cannot verify semantic correctness, only structural consistency
