/**
 * IGitWorkflowService -- Real git operations with safety enforcement.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - Query repository status, branches, logs, and diffs
 *   - Create branches, commits, and checkouts
 *   - Create checkpoint and milestone commits for AI workflow tracking
 *   - Rollback commits via git revert
 *   - Stash and pop changes
 *   - Enforce safety policies for destructive operations
 *
 * Limitations:
 *   - Git execution requires the git CLI to be available
 *   - Browser-based VS Code instances cannot spawn child processes;
 *     operations are logged and routed through VS Code's terminal infrastructure
 *   - Safety policies prevent accidental destructive operations but cannot
 *     guarantee protection against all misuse
