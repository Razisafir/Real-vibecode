/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  AI Execution Kernel -- Phase 29: Execution Lock & File Safety
 *  Real Vibecode -- AI-Native IDE
 *
 *  IExecutionLockService -- Concurrent access safety for file modifications.
 *
 *  REAL responsibilities:
 *    - File-level locks: prevent two autonomous edits on the same file
 *    - Project-level locks: prevent conflicting project-wide operations
 *    - Milestone-level locks: prevent conflicting milestone operations
 *    - Write queues: serialize concurrent writes to the same file
 *    - Deadlock prevention: detect and resolve circular lock waits
 *    - Lock expiration: auto-release locks after configurable timeout
 *    - Edit ownership tracking: know which loop/milestone owns each edit
 *    - Concurrent modification detection: detect user edits that conflict
 *      with autonomous edits
 *
 *  HARD RULES:
 *    - No two autonomous edits may touch the same file simultaneously
 *    - User edits invalidate autonomous stale state
 *    - Execution loop must halt on unsafe concurrent modifications
 *
 *  HONEST limitations:
 *    - This is advisory locking within the JS process; it cannot prevent
 *      external processes from modifying files
 *    - Lock state is in-memory; lost on crash (by design - stale locks
 *      should not survive a crash)
