/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  AI Execution Kernel -- Phase 29: Terminal Session Manager
 *  Real Vibecode -- AI-Native IDE
 *
 *  ITerminalSessionManagerService -- Session lifecycle tracking for terminal
 *  command execution. Adds true session semantics on top of the output-file-
 *  redirect pattern from Phase 28.
 *
 *  REAL responsibilities:
 *    - Assign unique execution IDs to every command
 *    - Associate output files to execution IDs
 *    - Track command states (queued, running, completed, failed, stuck, timedOut)
 *    - Heartbeat timestamps for active commands
 *    - Detect stuck executions (no output growth for configurable period)
 *    - Detect abandoned output files (orphaned from any active execution)
 *    - Stale process detection and timeout escalation
 *    - Terminal health tracking (success rate, average latency, stuck count)
 *    - Execution ownership (which loop/milestone owns which command)
 *    - Persist session state to IStorageService for crash recovery
 *    - Restore active sessions after VS Code restart
 *    - Command aging metrics (how long commands take by type)
 *
 *  HONEST limitations:
 *    - Cannot truly kill processes from browser workbench
 *    - Stuck detection relies on file size not growing, which may miss
 *      commands that produce output intermittently
 *    - Session restoration cannot resume lost terminal state; it only
 *      restores bookkeeping metadata
