/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  AI Execution Kernel -- Phase 29: Repair Intelligence
 *  Real Vibecode -- AI-Native IDE
 *
 *  IRepairIntelligenceService -- Iterative repair improvement with learning.
 *
 *  REAL responsibilities:
 *    - Iterative repair memory: remember past repair attempts and outcomes
 *    - Failure history: track all failures and their resolutions
 *    - Failed repair avoidance: do not retry identical failed repairs
 *    - Repair strategy scoring: rank strategies by historical success
 *    - Confidence tracking: assign confidence scores to repair suggestions
 *    - Root-cause clustering: group similar failures together
 *    - Multi-attempt contextual repair: consider previous attempts in new repairs
 *    - Repair outcome learning: update strategy scores based on outcomes
 *    - Prevent infinite repair loops: enforce hard limits with escalation
 *
 *  HARD RULES:
 *    - Do not retry identical failed repairs
 *    - Track worsening repairs (repairs that make things worse)
 *    - Prioritize smallest viable fix
 *    - Classify repair risk before applying
 *    - Prevent infinite repair loops
 *
 *  HONEST limitations:
 *    - Strategy scoring is heuristic, not ML-based
 *    - Root-cause clustering uses text similarity, not semantic analysis
 *    - Confidence scores are estimates based on past outcomes, not
 *      predictive models
 *    - Learning is session-scoped; no cross-session persistence yet
