/**
 * ICodeEditingService -- Real Code Editing Pipeline.

 *   - Unified diff generation (simplified Myers algorithm)
 *   - Edit preview with risk assessment
 *   - Conflict detection against backup snapshots
 *   - Text-based syntax validation (NOT AST-based)
 *   - Batch edit support with partial failure handling
 *   - Rollback via backup restoration
 *
 * HONEST limitations:
 *   - Syntax validation uses text-based checks (brace matching, quote
 *     matching, indentation consistency). It does NOT use an AST parser
 *     and will miss semantic errors like type mismatches or undefined
 *     references.
 *   - Backup snapshots are stored in-memory. They are lost when the
 *     service is disposed or the application restarts.
 *   - Conflict detection compares against the backup snapshot, not
 *     against version control or external modification timestamps.
