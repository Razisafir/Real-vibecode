/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Agent Orchestration System — Phase 7 Autonomous Execution Layer
 *  Real Vibecode — AI-Native IDE
 *
 *  IAgentOrchestratorService — The Agent Orchestration Runtime.
 *  A runtime execution orchestration system for autonomous software workflows.
 *
 *  This is NOT:
 *    - A chatbot
 *    - Inline autocomplete
 *    - Prompt history
 *
 *  This IS:
 *    - A runtime execution orchestration system for autonomous software workflows
 *    - Agents operate through execution plans, never direct mutation
 *    - All mutations route through AIExecutionService
 *    - Agent actions become graph nodes
 *    - Multi-agent support is future-compatible
 *
 *  Core Concepts:
 *    - Agent: an autonomous execution unit with declared capabilities
 *    - Task: a unit of work assigned to an agent
 *    - Plan: a structured multi-step execution strategy
 *    - Step: a single action within a plan
 *    - ExecutionScope: the boundary within which an agent operates
 *    - Capability: a declared permission an agent requires
 *    - Constraint: a restriction on agent behavior
 *    - Observation: a structured event produced by agent execution
 *    - Result: the outcome of a completed step/plan
 *
 *  Agent Lifecycle:
 *    Idle → Planning → Executing → Waiting → Suspended → Completed/Failed/Cancelled
 *
 *  Hard Rules:
 *    1. Agents MUST NOT directly mutate workspace state
 *    2. ALL mutations MUST route through AIExecutionService
 *    3. Agents MUST operate through execution plans
 *    4. Agents MUST be observable + interruptible
 *    5. Agent actions MUST become graph nodes
 *    6. Multi-agent support must be future-compatible
 *    7. Agent runtime must survive partial failure
