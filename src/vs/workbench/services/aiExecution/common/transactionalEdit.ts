/*---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  AI Execution Kernel -- Phase 29: Transactional Edit System
 *  Real Vibecode -- AI-Native IDE
 *
 *  ITransactionalEditService -- Atomic edit batches with rollback guarantees.
 *
 *  REAL responsibilities:
 *    - Atomic edit batches: all edits in a batch succeed or all rollback
 *    - Staged writes: prepare all writes, validate, then commit atomically
 *    - Validation-before-commit: verify each edit before writing to disk
 *    - Rollback-on-partial-failure: if any edit in a batch fails, undo all
 *    - Integrity hashes: SHA-256 hashes of files before and after edits
 *    - Edit journaling: persist edit records to disk for crash recovery
 *    - Transaction logs: record start, progress, completion of each batch
 *    - Recovery replay: after a crash, replay incomplete transactions
 *
 *  HARD RULES:
 *    - Batch edits either fully succeed or fully rollback
 *    - No partial project corruption from failed batches
 *    - Recovery after crash during edits must be possible
 *
 *  HONEST limitations:
 *    - Atomicity is at the file-service level, not true filesystem atomicity
 *    - If VS Code crashes between individual file writes in a batch, some
 *      files may be written and others not. The journal enables recovery
 *      but cannot prevent partial state from existing momentarily.
 *    - SHA-256 hashing adds latency proportional to file size.
