/**
 * IExecutionVerificationService -- Verify code changes through real tooling.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - Run build verification (npm run build, tsc, etc.)
 *   - Run lint verification (eslint with config detection)
 *   - Run type-check verification (tsc --noEmit)
 *   - Run test verification (jest, vitest, mocha, pytest, etc.)
 *   - Run dependency verification (package.json vs node_modules)
 *   - Run import resolution verification (static import analysis)
 *   - Run full verification suites with fail-fast and blocking policies
 *   - Determine whether a verification result should block execution
 *
 * Limitations:
 *   - Build/lint/typecheck/test execution requires the corresponding CLI tools
 *   - Browser-based VS Code cannot spawn child processes; verification relies
 *     on VS Code's terminal infrastructure or the extension host process
 *   - Dependency and import resolution checks use file system access which
 *     is limited to workspace scope
 *   - Test runners must be configured in the project for test verification
 *   - Verification results are only as reliable as the tooling they invoke
